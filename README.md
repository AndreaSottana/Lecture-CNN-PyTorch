# Lecture-CNN-PyTorch
Learn the fundamentals of modern computer vision with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We'll look at how CNNs work and what they could be used for. Then we'll analyse common architectures used in industry and research. Finally we'll put it all together in a short computer vision demo.
